- Next Meeting at 2019-10-22 from 14:00pm to 16:00pm
- Hossam
  - Writing to file in little endian.
  - Researching big endian format.
- Nicola
  - Converting waveform values from [-1.0,1.0] scale to byte format [-127,127]
  - Prototyping on buffer processing. Input type will be either `[[Real]]` or `[[[Real]]]`

  - Create a wavetable for basic Sine function
    - Create list of 2205 sample points.
    - 4800 samples if ambitious.
  - Implement record type for wave signatures.
    - List of Harmonic values
    - List of amplitude (timbre) values.
- Nghia
  - Help Hossam :P
- Evan
  - Researching big endian
  - Implementing wave tables in C++ for demonstration and to show code.
